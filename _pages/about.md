# 👋 Hi, I'm Nick.

I live with my wife and two sons in Colorado Springs, doing college ministry to reach the next generation with the gospel and equipping them to walk with the Lord for a lifetime.

I am a MDiv candidate at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.

I enjoy reading, tech, theology, and coffee. Chances are, if you like those things, you'll like it around here.
