# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nick.

I live with my wife and two sons in Colorado Springs, making disciples on college campuses and in the local church to train and equip them to walk with the Lord for a lifetime.

I am a MDiv candidate at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.

I enjoy reading, tech, theology, and coffee. Chances are, if you like those things, you'll like it around here.
