I live with my wife and two sons in Colorado Springs where I spend the best part of my week making disciples on college campuses and in the local church by sharing the gospel, teaching the Bible, and equipping the saints for ministry.

I have a Master of Divinity (MDiv) from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.

I am passionate about the Bible, theology, discipleship, and good gifts in life like black coffee, learning, friendship, reading, and Graeter's black raspberry chip ice cream. Chances are, if you like those things, we will become fast friends.
