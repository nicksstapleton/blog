Youâ€™re here to find a discount and save money on your Logos Bible Software purchase. **Good news: There are several ways to save money on Logos.**

In this post, Iâ€™m going to share the best ways to get a discount on your Logos base package and resources.
## 1. Use [my partner link discount](https://partner.logosbible.com/click.track?CID=431490&AFID=467957) (Up to 30% off plus five *FREE* books)

I am a Logos affiliate and proud of it. And this is a legitimate discount.

Logos has been an invaluable tool in my ministry, seminary studies, sermon prep, and personal growth. I love telling others about why itâ€™s worth the investment and how to get started.

In return for people sending readers from my website to Logos, I get a small kickback at no cost to you.

[My partner link](https://partner.logosbible.com/click.track?CID=431490&AFID=467957)Â will get you between a 10-30% discount on your Logos library (depending on the time of year) and fiveÂ _free_Â books as well!

## 2. Buy a Base Package

The best way to get the resources you want at a discount is to find them in Logos base packages.

What is a base package? Logos features + deep discounted resources. Thatâ€™s it.

Some people avoid Logos base packages, but thatâ€™s a mistake. While base packages may contain resources you do not foresee using, they also include resources you want at a steep discount. You can buy Logos resources a la carte, but you will almost certainly overspend.

If nothing else, you pay for the resources you want and get hundreds of others thrown in at little or no extra cost.

If you want help picking out a base package, read my [Logos Buyerâ€™s Guide](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-buyers-guide/).

## 3. Academic Discount

If you're a seminary student, sign up for the [Logos Academic Discount](https://partner.logosbible.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/academic-discount)! This student discount will get you 30% off of base packages and up to 50% off of essential academic resources.

## 4. Is the resource you want included in a base package?

Check this out: If I wanted to buy the _Dictionary of Classical Hebrew_ it would cost me $339.99, but if I buy the Logos Academic Premium base package I can get it and dozens of other resources thrown in for $108.53. ðŸ¤¯

This is the glory of Logos base packages. If there are specific resources you want, check on the resource page to see if theyâ€™re included in any Logos base packages. This is the best way to get your resource, sometimes cheaper than its list price on its own _and_ get more resources thrown in for cheap (or free)!

## 5. Grab the [Free Book of the Month](https://partner.logosbible.com/click.track?CID=437858&AFID=467957)
