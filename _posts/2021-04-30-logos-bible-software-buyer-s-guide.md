## Overview

Logos is one of the best investments I have ever made. It has been an incredible resource for my own growth, learning, seminary studies, and ministry.

This post is written for those who have already decided they want to get into Logos. If youâ€™re still on the fence, consider reading [why you should buy Logos](https://www.nickstapleton.me/Why-You-Should-Buy-Logos-9/).

My journey with Logos began with several questions such as:

* _What base package(s) should I buy?_
* _Which resources are a must-have?_
* _What is the most cost-effective way to get into Logos?_

I write from the perspective of having been in vocational ministry for over 10 years and as an MDiv student. My input is likely best suited for those in ministry and/or seminary.

While not comprehensive, this buyerâ€™s guide aims to provide some direction so you can decide which route into Logos is best for you.

## Why Buy a Base Package?

The most cost-effective route into Logos is with a base package. Why? Base packages = **discounted resources** + **features** According to Logos, base packages save you 90% compared to purchasing books and features individually.

### Resources

Initially, I thought base packages were overpriced and full of resources I would never use. However, I have since learned that while there may be resources you do not foresee using, they also include resources you want at a steep discount. You can buy Logos resources a la carte, but I can almost guarantee you will overspend. Worst case: you pay for the resources you want and get hundreds of others thrown in at no extra cost. Base packages are the most cost-effective way of getting the resources you want.

### Features

While having your resources in digital form is awesome, having features, workflows, and datasets which further utilize them is even better. The most recent version of Logos introduces new features and improves others: sermon builder, factbook, counseling guide, and dark mode.

## Which Base Package Should You Buy?

Ultimately, there are two questions you need to answer:

* What resources and features do you want?
* What is your budget?

An important principle to keep in mind: Logos is only as useful as the resources you have inside of it. At the risk of stating the obvious: If you want access to top commentaries, lexicons, and Bible dictionaries, you need to get them in there.

When I first purchased Logos in 2009, I bought an entry-level package and expected it to perform exegetical magic. I eventually realized that Logos isnâ€™t going to magically revolutionize your study of the Bible simply by buying any package. You need to know what you want Logos to do for you and ensure you are getting the tools to accomplish your desired task.

Here are the base packages I recommend you considerâ€¦

#### [Logos 9 Gold](https://partner.logosbible.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=460205&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/195377/logos-9-gold)

![](/assets/images/standard_gold_315.png)Forgive the pun, but this package is the gold standard and offers incredible value to anyone in vocational ministry. Starting with Gold and up, you get all of the features Logos offers. Additionally, there are some fantastic resources for Biblical studies, preaching, exegesis, and theology. Some highlights include:

* The Pillar NT Commentary series (17 vols.)

![](/assets/images/standard_platinum_315.png)If you are pursuing an MDiv or doing original language studies, this is the package you want. This package includes all of the L9 Gold features and resources but also adds more technical commentaries, original language resources, as well as advanced dictionaries, and theological studies resources. Some highlights include:

* IVP Bible Dictionary Series (8 Vols.)
* The New International Greek Testament Commentary (13 vols.)

## A Word to Seminary Students

Most seminary students I know are not flush with cash and do not have a book budget like some pastors. Many work multiple jobs and have to take on loans simply to get through seminary. Access to a resource like Logos is a privilege.

If you are in a position to consider investing in Logos: Do it. If you will be purchasing textbooks for your courses, why not buy them in Logos and take all of your class notes inside Logos so that you can easily reference them for decades to come? It may be tempting to say that you will wait to invest in Bible software after you graduate, but I am convinced that there is no better time to learn how to leverage Bible software than while you are in seminary. With the right resources in Logos, you will save yourself significant time and energy in the library that could free you up to spend more time with those you love. Further, you will develop proficiency with the software that will dramatically benefit your ministry upon graduation as you do sermon prep, counseling, personal study, and more.
