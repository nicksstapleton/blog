Youâ€™re here to find a discount and save money on Logos Bible Software. Maybe you are a student, pastor, missionary, or someone looking for a Logos coupon code. **I have good news: There are several ways to save money on Logos.**

In this post, Iâ€™m going to share the seven best tips to get a discount on your Logos subscription and library.

## 1. Become a Logos Subscriber using [my partner link](https://logos.sjv.io/stapleton) (Extended free trial and up to 30% off a library)

I am a Logos affiliate and proud of it. And this is a legitimate special offer.

Logos has been an invaluable tool in my ministry, seminary studies, sermon prep, and personal growth. I love telling others about why itâ€™s well worth the investment.

In return for sending readers from my website to Logos, I get a small commission at no cost to you and you receive a valuable special offer!

[My partner link](https://logos.sjv.io/stapleton)Â will get you an extra 30 days on your free trial Logos subscription and a 10-30% discount on your Logos library (depending on the time of year).

## 2. Logos Subscriber Rewards

Beyond all the features you gain access to through your Logos subscription, you also get discount rewards! As a subscriber you receive:
- 5% store-wide discount on all books
- Earn 5% annual reward coupon every February (Pro and Max subscriptions only)

If you subscribe using [my partner link](https://logos.sjv.io/stapleton), youÂ will receive an extra free 30 days on your Logos subscription.

## 3. Pay Annually for Your Logos Subscription

Beyond getting an extra 30-days free via [my partner offer](https://logos.sjv.io/stapleton), you can get more free months by paying upfront. If you pay annually, you will get two months free on your Logos subscription. If you pay two years upfront, you get FIVE months free on your Logos subscription. If you use [my link](https://logos.sjv.io/stapleton), that five months turns into six months free.

ðŸ”¥ That's effectively more than 35% off compared to paying month-to-month. 

## 4. Buy a Logos Library

The best way to get the resources you want at a discount is to find them in Logos libraries.

What is a Logos library? Deep discounted resources. Thatâ€™s it.

Some people avoid Logos libraries, but thatâ€™s a mistake. While a library may contain resources you do not foresee using, they also include resources you want at a steep discount. You can buy Logos resources a la carte, but you will almost certainly overspend.

If nothing else, you pay for the resources you want and get hundreds of others thrown in at little or no extra cost.

If you want direction and help picking out a library, read my [Logos Buyerâ€™s Guide](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-buyers-guide/).

## 5. Academic Student Discount

If you're a seminary student, sign up for the [Logos Academic Discount](https://logos.sjv.io/eKOJPj)! This student discount will get you 30% off of a Logos library and up to 50% off of essential academic resources.

## 6. Is the resource you want included in a library?

Check this out: If I wanted to buy the _Dictionary of Classical Hebrew_ it would cost me $339.99, but if I buy the Logos Academic Premium Library I can get it and dozens of other resources thrown in for $108.53. ðŸ¤¯

![Dynamic Pricing](/assets/images/dynamic.JPG "Dynamic Price")

This is the glory of Logos libraries. If there are specific resources you want, check on the resource page to see if theyâ€™re included in any Logos base packages. This is the best way to get your resource, sometimes cheaper than its list price on its own _and_ get more resources thrown in for cheap (or free)!

Speaking of resources, if you are looking for recommendations, I have written about the six most important categories to prioritize and suggest 50+ resources to build out your Logos library [here](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-resources/).

## 7. Grab the Free Book of the Month

Every month Logos gives away [a free book](https://logos.sjv.io/freebook). Many times they are awesome. If you're a Logos subscriber, you wil receive an extra free book every month!

## 8. Take advantage of the monthly sales

Logos runs a variety sales throughout the year. If youÂ [sign up for my newsletter](https://nickstapleton.ck.page/), I'll keep you posted on these special sales, especially when they apply to some of [my favorite key resources](https://partner.logosbible.com/click.track?CID=453900&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/nickstapleton).
