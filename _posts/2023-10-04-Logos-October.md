## ü§ì Logos Training Tip ‚Äî Prioritizing Resources

[![Logos Training Tip](https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/hNVjR73AvkowGNyNfboPNC/9F4tCfYVyDDGCTzKYtbHA4)](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019683652-Prioritize-Books)

[Prioritizing resources](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019683652-Prioritize-Books) is one of the most impactful customizations you can make inside Logos. It allows you to access your preferred books first in different areas of Logos (e.g. Top Bibles, Guides, pop-up menus within books, lookups, etc).

For example:
- You prefer a particular commentary series and want to see those books first when you use a Passage Guide.
- You prefer a particular dictionary or lexicon and want Logos to open that book when you double-click a word.
- You want to set a [preferred Bible version](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016817471).
- You want to edit the Bibles that appear in the [Top Bibles](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029571712) search.

Logos prioritization is based on references or indices as opposed to page numbers. Therefore, you‚Äôll get the most benefit by prioritizing books that are organized by headings other than page numbers (such as Bible reference, word/topic entry, devotional date, etc.).

A helpful way to think about this is to ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow would I look up information in this book?‚Äù You typically look up information in dictionaries by word or in commentaries by Bible reference, not by page number. Prioritizing books works best with reference works like Bibles, dictionaries, and commentaries. It is not intended to work with books like systematic theologies. ‚Äî[Source](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019683652-Prioritize-Books)
