### This is my why. This is what I want my ministry to be about.

Itâ€™s the very things that Jen Wilkin lays out in this chapel message given at DTS. Sobered by some our significant current realities about discipleship, theological formation, Bible literacy, and popular ministry philosophy, Jen calls churches and ministers to own the great commission with a larger vision for Biblical discipleship and resolve to teach the scriptures.

The decline of Bible literacy in the local church has resulted in a lack of theological understanding among believers, emphasizing the need for Christians to have a clear understanding of the scriptures. And while community is important, it should not come at the expense of biblical literacy. The Church needs to shift its approach to discipleship by actively teaching, equipping, and empowering believers to study the Bible for themselves and create active learning envirmonments where Christ-followers develop an understanding foundational theological concepts. 

This is a matter of great importance and urgency to me
