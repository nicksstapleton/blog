## Overview

Logos is one of the best investments I have ever made. It has been an incredible resource for my own growth, learning, seminary studies, and ministry.

My journey with Logos began with several questions such as:

* _What Logos base package(s) should I buy?_
* _Which resources are a must-have?_
* _What is the most cost-effective way to get into Logos?_

I write from the perspective of having been in vocational ministry for over 10 years and as an MDiv student. My input is best suited for pastors, seminary students, or other vocational ministers. This post is written for those who have already decided they want to get into Logos. If you’re still on the fence, [read my Logos 10 review](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-10-review-live-in-the-word/).

This buyer’s guide provides buying principles and package recommendations so you can decide which route into Logos is best for your purposes and needs.

## Buy a Base Package

The most cost-effective route into Logos is with a base package. Why?

* 💰📚 **Discounted Resources**
* **✨ Features**

According to Logos, base packages save you 90% compared to purchasing books and features individually.

### Discounted Resources

When I first began with Logos, I thought base packages were something to avoid since I considered them overpriced and full of resources I would never use. However, I have since learned that while there may be resources you do not foresee using, they also include resources you want at a steep discount. You can buy Logos resources a la carte, but you will almost certainly overspend.

Worst case with with a Logos package: you pay for the resources you want and get hundreds of others thrown in at little or no extra cost.

Base packages are the most cost-effective way of getting the resources you want.

Here are some of the resources I use and value the most and what Logos package they are available in:

* [Pillar NT Commentaries](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/210376/pillar-new-testament-commentary-pntc) ➡ Platinum or Anglican Gold
* [The IVP Bible Background Commentary](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/204338/the-ivp-bible-background-commentary) ➡ Bronze or Academic Essentials
* [New Dictionary of Biblical Theology](https://www.logos.com/product/27277/new-dictionary-of-biblical-theology?utm_source=Nick+Stapleton&utm_medium=partner&ClickID=10_148248992_8e37b70a-25cb-4b8a-9ae0-e51028d47714) ➡ Portfolio or Reformed Gold
* [IVP Bible Dictionaries](https://www.logos.com/product/37742/the-ivp-bible-dictionaries?utm_source=Nick+Stapleton&utm_medium=partner&ClickID=10_148234591_8f9209db-6584-4cfa-8aa5-bbc54549b17a) ➡ Diamond
* [Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament, 28th Edition, with Critical Apparatus](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/29980/nestle-aland-greek-new-testament-28th-edition-with-critical-apparatus) ➡ Academic Essentials
* [Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia with Apparatus](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/17645/biblia-hebraica-stuttgartensia-sesb-20-version-with-apparatus-and-wivu-introduction) ➡ Academic Essentials
* [BDAG](https://www.logos.com/product/3878/a-greek-english-lexicon-of-the-new-testament-and-other-early-christian-literature-3rd-ed) ➡ Diamond or Academic Professional
* [Exegetical Guide to the Greek New Testament](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/232317/exegetical-guide-to-the-greek-new-testament-eggnt) ➡ Diamond or Academic Professional

In the past, Logos made many of these resources available in standard packages like Gold or Platinum. With Logos 10, it feels like things have become either siloed into academic and denominational packages or you have to pay for a higher Standard package to get them. Depending on your needs, you may want to consider grabbing an academic or denominational package to get the resources you want. More on that below.

### Features

The other benefit of base packages is that you gain Logos features alongside your discounted resources. I love writing sermons and being able to quickly highlight and organize my notes right inside of Logos.

Here are some of the features I use and value the most and what Logos package they are available in:

* 🔎 Factbook ➡ Starter and up
* 📖 Passage Guide ➡ Starter and up
* 💡 Bible Word Study ➡ Starter and up
* 🗣 Sermon Builder + Preaching Mode ➡ Silver and up
* 📚 Print Library Catalog ➡ Gold and up

**A few things to note:**

* If you want to write sermons or use preaching mode in Logos, you need at least the Silver package or above.
* One of the most popular features released with Logos 10 is Print Library Catalog which requires at least Gold.
* Every feature Logos offers is available starting with the Gold package and above. If you're committed to getting at least Gold, this means you are choosing your package based on resources, not features.

If you are not after specific features, you can rest easy knowing the best features are included in any Logos package. You can explore all Logos features [here](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/features).

## Which Base Package Should You Buy?

Ultimately, there are two questions you need to answer:

1. What resources and features do you want?
2. What is your budget?

An important principle to keep in mind: Logos is only as useful as the resources you have inside of it. At the risk of stating the obvious, If you want access to top commentaries, lexicons, and Bible dictionaries, you need to have them in Logos.

When I first purchased Logos in 2009, I bought an entry-level package and expected it to somehow perform exegetical magic. I eventually realized that Logos isn’t going to magically revolutionize your study of the Bible simply by buying any package.

**You need to know what you want Logos to do for you and ensure you are getting the right resources and features to accomplish your desired task.**

## A Word to Seminary Students

Most seminary students are not flush with cash. Many work multiple jobs and have to take out loans simply to get through seminary. Access to a resource like Logos is a privilege.

If you are in a position to consider investing in Logos: Do it.![](https://media.giphy.com/media/BjHIjM2YFC3rEUaMrw/giphy.gif)

If you will be purchasing textbooks for your courses, why not buy them in Logos and take all of your class notes inside Logos so that you can easily reference them for decades to come? It may be tempting to say that you will wait to invest in Bible software after you graduate, but there is no better time to learn how to leverage Bible software than while you are in seminary.

With the right resources in Logos, you will save yourself significant time and energy in the library that could free you up to spend more time with those you love. Further, you will develop proficiency with the software that will dramatically benefit your ministry upon graduation as you do sermon prep, counseling, personal study, and more.

### Seminary Student Base Package Recommendation

Knowing cost-effectiveness is a premium for students, I suggest grabbing the following:

* [Logos 10 Gold](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/195377/logos-9-gold)
* [Academic Professional](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/228339/logos-10-academic-professional)

## Take Advantage of Sales

Logos runs special sales throughout the year, including a fantastic back-to-school sale in August and a top commentaries sale in September.
