Logos is an incredible tool for learning, Bible study, and ministry. Yet, Logos is only as good as the resources inside of it. **It's not Logos, it's the resources.**

So, what resources should you purchase? 

One of the strengths of Logos is its vast catalog. Yet, the possibilities can also be quite overwhelming. When I began building my library in Logos I wanted to know which tools were most worthy of investment.

You want to invest in great reference tools you will utilize over and over again for years to come. There are six categories you should think through and prioritize:

* Bible dictionaries
* Theological dictionaries
* Commentaries
* Systematic + Biblical Theologies
* Greek / Hebrew Texts + Lexicons
* Other reference resources (study bibles, etc.)
