November is here and we're entering Logos holiday deals territory! There are some great opportunities to save money and build your library.

## This Month's Sales at Logos

Logos is doing something new this month called Weekly Cyber Deals.

There are some excellent resources on **deep discount (some 75% off)** in this sale that you should pick up if you don't already own them. Here are a couple of my recommendations:

## ü§ì Logos Training Tip ‚Äî Using Layouts

[![As you use Logos, you will open and close many panels in the main application workspace. You‚Äôll probably want to use certain panels in a particular arrangement regularly. For example, you may want to have your preferred Bible, a commentary, and a Passage Guide open together, with link sets connecting them so they scroll synchronously. Opening and linking each panel each time you want to use this common configuration would be tedious.

Layouts allow you to permanently save a current or previous snapshot of the Logos workspace to access at a later time. Use this to set up your preferred workspace, with all the resources and tools you want to access quickly for reading a particular book or studying a specific topic. ‚Äî[Source](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016599631-What-are-Layouts-and-How-Do-I-Use-Them-)‚Äã](https://support.logos.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016599631-What-are-Layouts-and-How-Do-I-Use-Them-)
