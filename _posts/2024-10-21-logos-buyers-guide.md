## Overview

Logos is one of the best investments I have ever made. It has been an incredible resource for my own growth, learning, seminary studies, sermon prep, and ministry.

I have been leveraging Logos nearly every day for over 15 years and leaned on it heavily throughout my MDiv program in seminary. My input is best suited for pastors, seminary students, or other vocational ministers. This post is written for those who have already decided they want to get into Logos.[^1] 

[^1]:If you’re still on the fence, [read my Logos review](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-10-review/).

If you are just beginning with Logos or looking to go deeper, you are likely wondering:

* _Which Logos subscription and library should I buy?_
* _Are there any Logos discounts or buying tips I should know about?_
* _Which resources or features are a must-have?_

This buyer’s guide provides an overview and recommendations for Logos subscription tiers and libraries so you can decide which route into Logos is best for your purposes and needs. **Be sure to take advantage of my [exclusive offer](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-buyers-guide/#special-extended-free-trial-offer) on a Logos subscription at the end of this post.**

Let’s get into it.

## Logos Subscription Overview
Logos offers three subscription tiers — Premium, Pro, and Max. 

The three subscription tiers are aimed at three different use-cases:
- Small group prep (Logos Premium)
- Pastoral ministry and sermon prep (Logos Pro)
- Academic and original language study (Logos Max)

Ultimately, a subscription provides you the following:
- Ongoing feature updates or improvements every six weeks
- Cloud and AI feature access
- New library base package access
- Mobile Ed Access
- Reward perks
	- 5% store-wide discount on all books
	- An extra free book each month
	- Earn 5% annual reward coupon every February (Pro and Max only)
	- Logos online sermon database (Pro and Max only)

With the move to a subscription model, Logos is able to introduce a lower price of entry, Al/cloud features, continuous feature upgrades, and a faster feedback loop for a better product. This is one of the rare instances where a subscription actually feels like a significant value add and improvement.

### Important Details about Logos Subscriptions 

Logos subscriptions work differently than most subscription models. When you stop paying for your Netflix subscription, you lose all access to Netflix. That's not how Logos subscriptions work.

With Logos, if you cancel your subscription after you’ve subscribed for 24 months, you’ll be given a Legacy Fallback License automatically.

A Legacy Fallback License allows you to keep offline features when you cancel your subscription after 24 consecutive months. Instead of falling back to a free or previous version of Logos, you'll keep the core features from your subscription tier that don't rely on the cloud or AI.

This is why I view Logos subscriptions more along the lines of a payment plan. You’re paying your way towards a Legacy Fallback License and will keep the features if decide to cancel after 24 months.

And again, any books, features, or content you purchase are yours forever and accessible regardless of your subscription status.

### Logos Subscription Pricing

The price for each subscription tier varies. If you own a Logos 10 or earlier package, you can get a cheaper price than those who are all together new to Logos. Additionally, you can get two months free if you pay annually and five months free if you pay for two years upfront. Here's an overview of the pricing.

## Logos Libraries Overview
![](/assets/images/l10-cost-and-affordability-illu-1-2x.png)

Logos libraries are the most cost-effective route to build your library. Why?

According to Logos, their libraries save you 90% compared to purchasing books individually.

New libraries are only available to purchase for Logos subscribers and are perpetual licenses, which means even if you cancel your Logos subscription, you will still keep and retain access to your books.

When I first began with Logos, I thought libraries were something to avoid since I considered them overpriced and full of resources I would never use. However, I have since learned that while there may be resources you do not foresee using, they also include resources you want at a steep discount. You can buy Logos resources a la carte, but you will almost certainly overspend.

Worst-case scenario with a Logos library: you pay for the resources you want and get hundreds of others thrown in at little or no extra cost.

Libraries are the most cost-effective way of getting the resources you want.

*Important note: You must have a current Logos subscription to access purchasing the new library base packages.* 

## Which Logos Subscription and Library Should I Buy?

Ultimately, there are three questions you need to answer:

1. What features do you want?
2. What resources do you want?
3. What is your budget?

![](/assets/images/LogosFeaturesLibrary.gif)

Logos is only as useful as the resources and features you have inside of it. If you want to access the top commentaries, lexicons, and Bible dictionaries, you need to have them in Logos.

When I first purchased Logos in 2009, I bought an entry-level library package and expected it to somehow perform exegetical magic. Eventually, I realized that Logos isn’t going to magically revolutionize my study of the Bible simply by buying any package.

> **_You need to know what you want Logos to do for you and ensure you are getting the right features and resources to accomplish your desired task._**

</figure>
This is an ideal library for anyone doing academic research or advanced exegesis. This package is premium yet offers tremendous value and includes some of my favorite resources. The _Pillar New Testament Commentary_ series is full of the top commentaries for various books of the Bible. The _Exegetical Guide to the Greek New Testament_ is incredibly valuable if you are working in the Greek New Testament. I really appreciated having this series on hand while navigating my Greek Exegesis courses. This library is filled with scholarly and advanced biblical reference works. 

- _Pillar New Testament Commentary (17 vols.)_

## A Word to Seminary Students: Get Logos Now

Seminary students are not flush with cash. Many work multiple jobs and take out loans to get through seminary. Access to a resource like Logos is a privilege.

If you are in a position to consider investing in Logos: Do it.![](https://media.giphy.com/media/BjHIjM2YFC3rEUaMrw/giphy.gif)

If you will be purchasing textbooks for your courses, why not buy them in Logos and take all of your class notes inside Logos so that you can easily reference them for decades to come? It may be tempting to say that you will wait to invest in Bible software after you graduate, but there is no better time to learn how to leverage Bible software than while you are in seminary.

With the right resources in Logos, you will save yourself significant time and energy in the library that could free you up to spend more time with those you love. Further, you will develop proficiency with the software that will dramatically benefit your ministry upon graduation as you do sermon prep, counseling, personal study, and more.

### Seminary Student Base Package Recommendation

For students, I suggest getting these this subscription and package:

- Subscription: [Logos Pro](https://logos.sjv.io/stapleton)
- Library: [Logos Diamond](https://logos.sjv.io/stapleton)

If you're a seminary student, don’t forget to sign up for the [Logos Academic Discount](https://logos.sjv.io/eKOJPj)! This will get you 30% off of base packages and up to 50% off of essential academic resources.
