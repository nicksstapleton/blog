> Don’t be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a person sows he will also reap, because the one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit﻿ will reap eternal life﻿ from the Spirit. Let us not get tired﻿ of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don’t give up. —Galatians 6:7–9 (CSB)

This is one of the most powerful sermons I have ever heard. It felt like I had never read Galatians 6:7-9 before. Every time I listen to Mason preach, I feel like he knows me.

Some of my notes:
1. In a world where truth is subjective and accountability is absent, mankind has turned away from God.
2. The church is in danger of focusing on getting felt needs met at the expense of ignoring foundational realities.
3. We should not view Jesus and the church solely as means to fulfill our individual desires and emotional needs.
4. The primary view of Jesus in the role of the church involves living in interdependence and building each other up in love for God's glory.
5. Having head knowledge of God is not enough; we need to have a functional heart knowledge of what we believe.
6. Faith without works is dead.
7. To sow to the spirit, be a disciple of Jesus and recognize your brokenness.
8. Being transformed through the ongoing process of progressive sanctification and renewing one's mind is important for living out your faith.
9. Transforming thoughts, attitudes, and choices to honor God is crucial.
10. Regularly participating in worship and being together in person is powerful and inspiring.
11. Life this side of glory is a mix of joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain.
12. Perseverance is crucial for sowing to the spirit and reaping eternal life.
