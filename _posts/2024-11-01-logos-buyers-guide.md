## Overview

Logos is one of the best investments I have ever made. It has been an incredible tool and resource for learning, seminary, Bible study, sermon prep, and ministry.

I have been leveraging Logos nearly every day for over 15 years and leaned on it heavily throughout my MDiv program in seminary. My input is best suited for pastors, seminary students, and other vocational ministers. This post is written for those who have already decided they want to get into Logos.

If you are just beginning with Logos or looking to go deeper, you are likely wondering:

* _Which Logos subscription and library should I buy?_
* _Are there any Logos discounts or buying tips I should know about?_
* _Which resources or features are a must-have?_

In this post, I will provide an overview and recommendations for Logos subscription tiers and libraries so you can decide which route into Logos is best for your purposes and needs. **Be sure to take advantage of my [exclusive offer](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-buyers-guide/#special-extended-free-trial-offer) on a Logos subscription at the end of this post.**

Let‚Äôs get into it.

## Logos Subscription Overview
Logos offers three subscription tiers ‚Äî Premium, Pro, and Max. 

The three subscription tiers are aimed at three different use-cases:
- Small group prep (Logos Premium)
- Pastoral ministry and sermon prep (Logos Pro)
- Academic and original language study (Logos Max)

Ultimately, a subscription provides you the following:
- Ongoing feature updates or improvements every six weeks
- Cloud and AI feature access
- New Logos library access
- Mobile Ed Access
- Reward perks
	- 5% store-wide discount on all books
	- An extra free book each month
	- Earn 5% annual reward coupon every February (Pro and Max only)
	- Logos online sermon database (Pro and Max only)

With the move to a subscription model, Logos is able to introduce a lower price of entry, Al/cloud features, continuous feature upgrades, and a faster feedback loop for a better product. This is one of the rare instances where a subscription actually feels like a significant value add and improvement.

### Important Details about Logos Subscriptions 

Logos subscriptions work differently than most subscription models. When you stop paying for your Netflix subscription, you lose all access to Netflix. That's not how Logos subscriptions work.

With Logos, if you cancel your subscription after you‚Äôve subscribed for 24 months, you‚Äôll be given a Legacy Fallback License automatically.

A Legacy Fallback License allows you to keep offline features when you cancel your subscription after 24 consecutive months. Instead of falling back to a free or previous version of Logos, you'll keep the core features from your subscription tier that don't rely on the cloud or AI.

This is why I view Logos subscriptions more along the lines of a payment plan. You‚Äôre paying your way towards a Legacy Fallback License and will keep the features if you decide to cancel after 24 months.

And again, any books, features, or content you purchase are yours forever and accessible regardless of your subscription status.

### Logos Subscription Pricing

The price for each subscription tier varies. If you own a Logos 10 or earlier package, you can get a cheaper price than those who are all together new to Logos. Additionally, you can get two months free if you pay annually and five months free if you pay for two years upfront. Here's an overview of the pricing.

## Logos Libraries Overview
![](/assets/images/l10-cost-and-affordability-illu-1-2x.png)

Logos libraries are the most cost-effective route to build your library. Why?

According to Logos, their libraries save you 90% compared to purchasing books individually.

New libraries are only available to purchase for Logos subscribers and are perpetual licenses, which means even if you cancel your Logos subscription, you will still keep and retain access to your books.

When I first began with Logos, I thought libraries were something to avoid since I considered them overpriced and full of resources I would never use. However, I have since learned that while there may be resources you do not foresee using, they also include resources you want at a steep discount. You can buy Logos resources a la carte, but you will almost certainly overspend.

Worst-case scenario with a Logos library: you pay for the resources you want and get hundreds of others thrown in at little or no extra cost.

Libraries are the most cost-effective way of getting the resources you want.

*Important note: You must have a current Logos subscription to access purchasing the new library base packages.* 

## Which Logos Subscription and Library Should I Buy?

Ultimately, there are three questions you need to answer:

1. What features do you want?
2. What resources do you want?
3. What is your budget?

![](/assets/images/LogosFeaturesLibrary.gif)

Logos is only as useful as the resources and features you have inside of it. If you want to access the top commentaries, lexicons, and Bible dictionaries, you need to have them in Logos.

When I first purchased Logos in 2009, I bought an entry-level library package and expected it to somehow perform exegetical magic. Eventually, I realized that Logos isn‚Äôt going to magically revolutionize my study of the Bible simply by buying any package.

> **_You need to know what you want Logos to do for you and ensure you are getting the right features and resources to accomplish your desired task._**

## Logos Library Recommendations

### [Gold Library](https://logos.sjv.io/oqjP3m)

<figure style="width: 250px" class="align-right">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2025LogosLibraryGold.jpg" alt="">
</figure> 
Logos Gold provides a comprehensive Bible study library. With this library, you are gaining access to some fantastic commentaries, Bible study resources, and systematic theology works. Some standout resources include:

- _The Preacher‚Äôs Outline and Sermon Bible (45 vols.)_
- _ESV Expository Commentary Series Collection (11 vols.)_
- _God‚Äôs Word for You (33 vols.)_
- _Contours of Christian Theology (9 vols.)_
- _Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary Series Collection (42 vols.)_
- _Augustine‚Äôs Expositions of the Psalms Set, 6 vols. (The Works of Saint Augustine)_

### [Platinum Library](https://logos.sjv.io/oqjP3m)

<figure style="width: 250px" class="align-right">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2025LogosLibraryPlatinum.jpg" alt="">
</figure>
The Platinum Library is a great entry point option for academic study or more advanced exegesis and sermon prep. In a word, this library is more nerdy and will serve those wanting to go deeper. One resource I love in this library is the _SIL Exegetical Summary Series_. This series orients you to the exegetical interpretations and views of the most popular commentaries on a given passage and provides a hyperlink directly to that commentary. It's an incredible resource to help you grasp the lay of the land when it comes to interpreting a passage. This libray includes all of the Gold library resources but also adds more technical and theological studies resources.

- _Preaching the Word Commentary Series Collection (42 vols.)_
- _Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (6 vols.)_
- _Credo Magazine: 2010-2021 (11 vols.)_
- _International Theological Commentary Series Collection (5 vols.)_
- _SIL Exegetical Summary Series (34 vols.)_

### [Diamond Library](https://logos.sjv.io/oqjP3m)

<figure style="width: 250px" class="align-right">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2025LogosLibraryDiamond.jpg" alt="">
</figure>
This is an ideal library for anyone doing academic research or advanced exegesis. This package is premium yet offers tremendous value and includes some of my favorite resources. The _Pillar New Testament Commentary_ series and _New International Commentary on the Old and New Testament_ series are full of the top commentaries for various books of the Bible. The _Exegetical Guide to the Greek New Testament_ is incredibly valuable if you are working in the Greek New Testament. I really appreciated having this series on hand while navigating my Greek Exegesis courses. This library is filled with scholarly and advanced biblical reference works. 

- _Pillar New Testament Commentary (17 vols.)_
- _Exegetical Guide to the Greek New Testament (14 vols.)_
- _New International Commentary on the Old and New Testament: Heritage Collection (26 vols.)_
- _Wiley Blackwell Bible Commentaries (22 vols.)_

## Role Library Recommendations - Researcher, Leader, Preacher
Generally, I recommend the standard packages above for most Logos users. However, if you are looking for a more specialized library based on your ministry or academic role, these are some great packages to consider. 

### [Researcher Gold](https://logos.sjv.io/55a56N) 
Are you a seminary student? This library is an incredible value. Over $9,000 worth of resources for under $600. In this library are some fantastic commentaries and essential original language resources (NA28, BHS, BDAG). Also notable: this library is the cheapest route to obtaining the _Pillar New Testament Commentary_ series, which boasts some of the best commentaries on books in the New Testament. If you are in seminary, this library is a worthwhile investment for resources you will certainly need and use.

- _Pillar New Testament Commentary (17 vols.)_
- _Apollos Old Testament Commentary (13 vols.)_
- _International Critical Commentary (68 vols.)_
- _A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 3rd ed. (BDAG)_
- _Dictionary of Classical Hebrew (9 vols.)_
- _Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament, 28th Edition, with Critical Apparatus (NA28)_
- _Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia with Critical Apparatus (BHS)_

### [Preacher Gold](https://logos.sjv.io/o4R4Qg)
Among the Preacher libraries, I feel Preacher Gold strikes the best balance between resources and value. Compared to the standard Gold library, this library allocates far more resources to Biblical commentaries, pastoral care and counseling, and preaching. Personally, I still favor the more academic-leaning standard Gold library, but for the right preacher, this package could be worth considering for the increased preaching commentaries and tools. Notable resources include:

- _Preaching the Word Commentary Series (42 vols.)_
- _ESV Expository Commentary Series Collection (11 vols.)_
- _Tyndale Old Testament and New Testament Commentary Series (47 vols.)_
- _New Growth Press Minibooks: Sexuality Collection (11 vols.)_

### Leader Libraries
Compared to the standard libraries, the Leader libraries exchange theology, NT/OT studies, counseling, and language resources for more commentaries and devotionals. Admittedly, I struggle to imagine purchasing a Leader library over a standard library. Perhaps it is the seminary graduate, theology nerd, or Biblical studies enthusist in me. In the standard Gold library, you are gaining access to fantastic systematic theology resources like the _Contours of Christian Theology_ series that I am not eager to give up! Personally, I cannot identify commentaries or other distinct resources in the Leader libraries that feel worth the trade-off. 

## Denominational Libraries

If you are looking for denominational package libraries, they are expected to launch sometime in early 2025.

## A Word to Seminary Students: Get Logos Now

Seminary students are not flush with cash. Many work multiple jobs and take out loans to get through seminary. Access to a resource like Logos is a privilege.

If you are in a position to consider investing in Logos: Do it.![](https://media.giphy.com/media/BjHIjM2YFC3rEUaMrw/giphy.gif)

If you will be purchasing textbooks for your courses, why not buy them in Logos and take all of your class notes inside Logos so that you can easily reference them for decades to come? It may be tempting to say that you will wait to invest in Bible software after you graduate, but there is no better time to learn how to leverage Bible software than while you are in seminary.

With the right resources in Logos, you will save yourself significant time and energy in the library that could free you up to spend more time with those you love. Further, you will develop proficiency with the software that will dramatically benefit your ministry upon graduation as you do sermon prep, counseling, personal study, and more.

### Seminary Student Subscription and Library Recommendation

For students, I suggest this subscription and library:
- **[Logos Max](https://logos.sjv.io/stapleton)**
- **[Logos Researcher Gold](https://logos.sjv.io/55a56N)**

The Logos Max subscription will empower writing academic papers and provide advanced original language tools. The Researcher Gold library includes essential language resources (NA28, BHS, BDAG, etc.) and excellent commentaries all at a steep discount.

If you're a seminary student, don‚Äôt forget to sign up for the [Logos Academic Discount](https://logos.sjv.io/eKOJPj)! This will get you 30% off of base packages and up to 50% off of essential academic resources.
