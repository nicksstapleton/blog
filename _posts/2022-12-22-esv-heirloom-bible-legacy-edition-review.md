![](/assets/images/img_0295-large.jpeg)The ESV Heirloom Bible, Legacy Edition is a 6" x 9" luxurious and timeless Bible that will make a beautiful addition to any library. It is bound in high-quality leather from Horween, a renowned leather company based in Chicago, Illinois. It is assembled by  Royal Jongbloed in the Netherlands who is renowned for their craftsmanship. As Crossway states on their website, "This edition is modeled after the Renaissance ideal of a perfect pageâ€”featuring a simple, clear layout with generous margins."

The Horween leather used in the ESV Heirloom Bible is vegetable-tanned and hand-dyed. This means that it is made using natural materials and processes, resulting in a rich and deep color that will develop character and become more beautiful over time. The leather is also treated with oils and waxes to make it supple and durable, ensuring that it will last for many years to come.

One of the standout features of this Bible is its durable spine and binding. The spine is blind-stamped with the standard information, while the sewn binding ensures that the pages will stay securely in place. It's a clean, sharp look.

The text of the ESV Heirloom Bible, Legacy Edition is printed on high-quality paper using a special font that is easy to read. I especially love the layout and single column text that is based on the Renaissance ideal of the perfect page. The pages are smyth-sewn and lay flat, making it easy to read and study. The layout and text size also makes it a good candidate as a preaching Bible. the Bible includes a a basic concordance, as well as maps.

This makes the Heirloom a Bible that can be used and enjoyed on a daily basis without fear of damaging it. Though, you should be aware the Horween leather will show the slightest scratch. My copy started showing marks as soon as it left the box. If you like a Bible with character, look no further. If looking perfect or untouched is important to you, don't get the Horween.

The list price for the Bible is $399, which is no small amount of money. No one _needs_ to spend this much on a Bible. But, like many things, we invest more in the things we use often and care most about. For that amount, Crossway provides a lifetime guarantee for the Bible.

Overall, the ESV Heirloom Bible, Legacy Edition is a beautiful and timeless Bible that will make an excellent addition to any collection. Its high-quality construction and elegant design make it a true heirloom piece that will be treasured for generations to come.

If you are looking for a Bible that is both functional, easy to read, and beautiful, the ESV Heirloom Bible, Legacy Edition is the perfect choice.
