The ESV Heirloom Bible, Legacy Edition is a 6" x 9" luxurious and timeless Bible. It is bound in high-quality leather from Horween, a renowned leather company based in Chicago, Illinois. It is assembled by  Royal Jongbloed in the Netherlands who is renowned for their craftsmanship. As Crossway states on their website, "This edition is modeled after the Renaissance ideal of a perfect page—featuring a simple, clear layout with generous margins."

The Horween leather used in the ESV Heirloom Bible is vegetable-tanned and hand-dyed. This means that it is made using natural materials and processes, resulting in a rich and deep color that will develop character and become more beautiful over time. The leather is also treated with oils and waxes to make it supple and durable, ensuring that it will last for many years to come.

One of the standout features of this Bible is its durable spine and binding. The spine is blind-stamped with the standard information, while the sewn binding ensures that the pages will stay securely in place. It's a clean, sharp look.

The text of the ESV Heirloom Bible, Legacy Edition is printed on high-quality paper using a special font that is easy to read. I especially love the layout and single column text that is based on the Renaissance ideal of the perfect page. The pages are smyth-sewn and lay flat, making it easy to read and study. The layout and text size also makes it a good candidate as a preaching Bible. the Bible includes a a basic concordance, as well as maps.

This makes the Heirloom a Bible that can be used and enjoyed on a daily basis without fear of damaging it. Though, you should be aware the Horween leather will show the slightest scratch. My copy started showing marks as soon as it left the box. If you like a Bible with character, look no further. If looking perfect or untouched is important to you, don't get the Horween.

The list price for this Bible is $399. No small amount of change. Of course, no one _needs_ to spend this much on a Bible. But, like many things, we invest in the things we use often and care about most. For that amount of money, Crossway provides an excellent lifetime guarantee for the Bible.

If I have one criticism of the Bible, it is the four ribbon markers. Everything about the Bible feels premium except for these.

Overall, the ESV Heirloom Bible, Legacy Edition is a beautiful and timeless Bible that you will be excited to open and read. Its high-quality construction and elegant design should deliver for decades to come.

I’m a big fan of the size of this Bible and the layout of the text. The font is large enough to use when teaching, but the Bible isn’t so big that I don’t want to carry it with me. I take it with me everywhere I go daily. I also love the margin space and frequently write notes there.

If you are looking for a Bible that is both functional, easy to read, and beautiful, the ESV Heirloom Bible, Legacy Edition might be the one. I am excited to continue using my copy and see how it ages over time. It is something I plan to pass onto one of my kids someday.
