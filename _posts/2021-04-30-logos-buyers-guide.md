## Overview

Logos is one of the best investments I have ever made. It has been an incredible resource for my own growth, learning, seminary studies, and ministry.

My journey with Logos began with several questions such as:

* _What Logos base package(s) should I buy?_
* _Which resources are a must-have?_
* _What is the most cost-effective way to get into Logos?_

I write from the perspective of having been in vocational ministry for over 10 years and as an MDiv student. My input is best suited for people in ministry, pastors, and seminary students. This post is written for those who have already decided they want to get into Logos. If youâ€™re still on the fence, [read my Logos 10 review](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-10-review-live-in-the-word/).

This buyerâ€™s guide aims to provide some direction so you can decide which route into Logos is best for your purposes and needs.

## Buy a Base Package

The most cost-effective route into Logos is with a base package. Why?ðŸ’°ðŸ“š **Discounted Resources + âœ¨ Features**

According to Logos, base packages save you 90% compared to purchasing books and features individually.

### Resources

Initially, I thought base packages were overpriced and full of resources I would never use. However, I have since learned that while there may be resources you do not foresee using, they also include resources you want at a steep discount. You can buy Logos resources a la carte, but I can nearly guarantee you will overspend over time. Worst case: you pay for the resources you want and get hundreds of others thrown in at no extra cost. Base packages are the most cost-effective way of getting the resources you want.

### Features

Having your resources easily accessible in digital form is awesome. Having features, search-ability, workflows, and datasets which further utilize them is even better. I love writing sermons and being able to quickly highlight and organize my notes right inside of Logos. The ability to do searches across your entire library is unbelievable. Imagine having a research assistant who can comb through your entire library and bring you every resource relevant to a particular topic or Bible passage you are interested in learning more about in a matter of seconds. That research assistant has a name in Logos: Factbook.

The [newest version of Logos](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-10-review-live-in-the-word/) introduces new features and improves others: sermon builder quotes, print library, and search reimagined.

## My Favorite Resources + Features

In an effort to help you discern what package may suit you best, I want to share what resources and features I find most valuable in Logos.

### Resources

Here are some of the resources I use and value the most and what Logos package they are available in:

* [Pillar NT Commentaries](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/210376/pillar-new-testament-commentary-pntc) âž¡ Platinum or Anglican Gold
* [The IVP Bible Background Commentary](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/204338/the-ivp-bible-background-commentary) âž¡ Bronze or Academic Essentials
* [New Dictionary of Biblical Theology](https://www.logos.com/product/27277/new-dictionary-of-biblical-theology?utm_source=Nick+Stapleton&utm_medium=partner&ClickID=10_148248992_8e37b70a-25cb-4b8a-9ae0-e51028d47714) âž¡ Portfolio or Reformed Gold
* [IVP Bible Dictionaries](https://www.logos.com/product/37742/the-ivp-bible-dictionaries?utm_source=Nick+Stapleton&utm_medium=partner&ClickID=10_148234591_8f9209db-6584-4cfa-8aa5-bbc54549b17a) âž¡ Diamond
* [Dictionary of Biblical Imagery](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/30241/dictionary-of-biblical-imagery) âž¡ Portfolio or Reformed Gold
* [Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament, 28th Edition, with Critical Apparatus](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/29980/nestle-aland-greek-new-testament-28th-edition-with-critical-apparatus) âž¡ Academic Essentials
* [Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia with Apparatus](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/17645/biblia-hebraica-stuttgartensia-sesb-20-version-with-apparatus-and-wivu-introduction) âž¡ Academic Essentials
* [BDAG](https://www.logos.com/product/3878/a-greek-english-lexicon-of-the-new-testament-and-other-early-christian-literature-3rd-ed) âž¡ Diamond or Academic Professional
* [Exegetical Guide to the Greek New Testament](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/232317/exegetical-guide-to-the-greek-new-testament-eggnt) âž¡ Diamond or Academic Professional

In the past, Logos made many of these resources available in standard packages like Gold or Platinum. With Logos 10, it feels like things have become either siloed into academic and denominational packages or you have to pay for a higher Standard package to get them. Depending on your needs, you may want to consider grabbing an academic or denominational package to get the resources you want. More on that below.

### Features

Here are some of the features I use and value the most and what Logos package they are available in:

* Factbook âž¡ Starter and up
* Passage Guide âž¡ Starter and up
* Bible Word Study âž¡ Starter and up
* Sermon Builder âž¡ Silver and up
* Preaching Mode âž¡ Silver and up
* Print Library Catalog âž¡ Gold and up

If you want to write sermons or use preaching mode in Logos, you need at least the Silver package or above. Additionally, the new Print Library Catalog feature in Logos 10 requires at least Gold. If those are not features you will use, you can rest easy knowing the best features are included in any Logos package. You can explore all Logos features [here](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/features).

## Which Base Package Should You Buy?

Ultimately, there are two questions you need to answer:

1. What resources and features do you want?
2. What is your budget?

An important principle to keep in mind: Logos is only as useful as the resources you have inside of it. At the risk of stating the obvious, If you want access to top commentaries, lexicons, and Bible dictionaries, you need to have them in Logos.

When I first purchased Logos in 2009, I bought an entry-level package and expected it to somehow perform exegetical magic. I eventually realized that Logos isnâ€™t going to magically revolutionize your study of the Bible simply by buying any package. **You need to know what you want Logos to do for you and ensure you are getting the right resources and features to accomplish your desired task.**

### [Logos 10 Gold](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/228268/logos-10-gold) | Small group and Sunday school leaders

## A Word to Seminary Students

Most seminary students are not flush with cash and do not have a book budget like some pastors. Many work multiple jobs and have to take out loans simply to get through seminary. Having access to a resource like Logos is a privilege.

If you are in a position to consider investing in Logos: Do it.![](https://media.giphy.com/media/BjHIjM2YFC3rEUaMrw/giphy.gif)

If you will be purchasing textbooks for your courses, why not buy them in Logos and take all of your class notes inside Logos so that you can easily reference them for decades to come? It may be tempting to say that you will wait to invest in Bible software after you graduate, but I am convinced that there is no better time to learn how to leverage Bible software than while you are in seminary.

With the right resources in Logos, you will save yourself significant time and energy in the library that could free you up to spend more time with those you love. Further, you will develop proficiency with the software that will dramatically benefit your ministry upon graduation as you do sermon prep, counseling, personal study, and more.

### Seminary Student Base Package Recommendation

Knowing cost-effectiveness is a premium for students, I suggest grabbing the following:

* [Logos 10 Gold](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/195377/logos-9-gold)
* [Academic Professional](https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=432198&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/product/228339/logos-10-academic-professional)
