## Overview

Logos is one of the best investments I have ever made. It has been an incredible resource for my own growth, learning, seminary studies, and ministry.

This post is written for those who have already decided they want to get into Logos. If youâ€™re still on the fence, [read my Logos 10 review](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-10-review-live-in-the-word/).

My journey with Logos began with several questions such as:

* _What base package(s) should I buy?_
* _Which resources are a must-have?_
* _What is the most cost-effective way to get into Logos?_

I write from the perspective of having been in vocational ministry for over 10 years and as an MDiv student. My input is likely best suited for those in ministry and/or seminary.

While not comprehensive, this buyerâ€™s guide aims to provide some direction so you can decide which route into Logos is best for you.

## Buy a Base Package

The most cost-effective route into Logos is with a base package. Why?ðŸ’°ðŸ“š **Discounted Resources + âœ¨ Features**

According to Logos, base packages save you 90% compared to purchasing books and features individually.

### Resources

Initially, I thought base packages were overpriced and full of resources I would never use. However, I have since learned that while there may be resources you do not foresee using, they also include resources you want at a steep discount. You can buy Logos resources a la carte, but I can nearly guarantee you will overspend over time. Worst case: you pay for the resources you want and get hundreds of others thrown in at no extra cost. Base packages are the most cost-effective way of getting the resources you want.

### Features

Having your resources easily accessible in digital form is awesome. Having features, search-ability, workflows, and datasets which further utilize them is even better. I love writing sermons and being able to quickly highlight and organize my notes right inside of Logos. The ability to do searches across your entire library is unbelievable. Imagine having a research assistant who can comb through your entire library and bring you every resource relevant to a particular topic or Bible passage you are interested in learning more about in a matter of seconds. That research assistant has a name in Logos: Factbook.

The newest version of Logos introduces new features and improves others: sermon builder quotes, print library, and search reimagined. {% include gallery caption="" %}

## Which Base Package Should You Buy?

Ultimately, there are two questions you need to answer:

1. What resources and features do you want?
2. What is your budget?

An important principle to keep in mind: Logos is only as useful as the resources you have inside of it. At the risk of stating the obvious, if you want access to top commentaries, lexicons, and Bible dictionaries, you need to have them in Logos.

When I first purchased Logos in 2009, I bought an entry-level package and expected it to somehow perform exegetical magic. I eventually realized that Logos isnâ€™t going to magically revolutionize your study of the Bible simply by buying any package. **You need to know what you want Logos to do for you and ensure you are getting the right tools to accomplish your desired task.**

This package includes all of the L10 Gold features and resources but also adds more technical commentaries, and theological studies resources.

## A Word to Seminary Students

Most seminary students are not flush with cash and do not have a book budget like some pastors. Many work multiple jobs and have to take on loans simply to get through seminary. Access to a resource like Logos is a privilege.

If you are in a position to consider investing in Logos: Do it.![](https://media.giphy.com/media/BjHIjM2YFC3rEUaMrw/giphy.gif)

If you will be purchasing textbooks for your courses, why not buy them in Logos and take all of your class notes inside Logos so that you can easily reference them for decades to come? It may be tempting to say that you will wait to invest in Bible software after you graduate, but I am convinced that there is no better time to learn how to leverage Bible software than while you are in seminary.

With the right resources in Logos, you will save yourself significant time and energy in the library that could free you up to spend more time with those you love. Further, you will develop proficiency with the software that will dramatically benefit your ministry upon graduation as you do sermon prep, counseling, personal study, and more.
