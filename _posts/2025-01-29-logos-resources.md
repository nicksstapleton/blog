## It's not the plane, it's the pilot
In _Top Gun: Maverick_ there is a repeated mantra: **It's not the plane, it's the pilot.**

Logos is an incredible tool for learning, Bible study, and ministry. Yet, Logos is only as good as the resources inside of it. **It's not Logos, it's the resources.**

If you want the best commentaries and dictionaries to appear in your Logos searches, they need to be in your libary. 

One of the strengths of Logos is its vast catalog. When I began building my library, I wanted someone to tell me which resources were most helpful to them in their ministry, sermon prep, and personal Bible study. This is where I want to offer you help.

**Here's the most important principal when choosing resources: You want to invest in great reference tools you will utilize over and over again for years to come.** 

## Don't Sleep on Logos Libraries
Before recommending specific resources, it is important to note: **The most cost-effective way to get resources in Logos is with a Logos Library.** A Logos Library is the foundation you want to start with and build on. Logos offers everything from academic and denominational packages to starter or other general packages. **If you haven't already, be sure to read my [Logos Buyer's Guide](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-buyers-guide/) so you can buy the right library for you.**

## The Six Resource Categories to Priortize
The best way to build the ideal Logos library is to begin by thinking through categories and then selecting the top resources. Here are the six categories to prioritize, in no particular order:

1. Bible dictionaries
2. Theological dictionaries
3. Commentaries
4. Systematic + Biblical Theologies
5. Greek / Hebrew Texts + Lexicons
6. Other reference resources (study bibles, favorite books, etc.)
