![](/assets/images/logos-resources.png)One of the greatest benefits of Logos is the vast amount of resources you can add to your library. Yet, the possibilities can also be quite overwhelming. When I began building my library in Logos I wanted to know which tools were most worthy of investment.

Beyond [buying a Logos package](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-buyers-guide/) and grabbing the [free book of the month](https://partner.logosbible.com/click.track?CID=437858&AFID=467957), you want to invest in great reference tools you will utilize over and over again in Logos.

There are six categories you should think through and prioritize:

* Bible dictionaries
* Theological dictionaries
* Commentaries
* Systematic + Biblical Theologies
* Greek / Hebrew Texts + Lexicons
* Other reference resources (study bibles, etc.)


## My Logos Recommended Resource Page
I have been working with Logos to compile a list of [my most recommended resources](https://partner.logosbible.com/click.track?CID=453900&AFID=467957&nonencodedurl=https://www.logos.com/nickstapleton) for these categories right on Logos.com and it is now live![^1]
