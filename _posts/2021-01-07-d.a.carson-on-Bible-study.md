This quote has been solidified on my mind and heart ever since I first read it years ago. In fact, when people ask me why I am working towards my MDiv, this is my response every time.

An important word from D.A. Carson commenting on Ezra 7 and studying the Bible:

> â€œEzra devoted himself to the study of the Law. There is no long-range effective teaching of the Bible that is not accompanied by long hours of ongoing study of the Bible. **Effectiveness in teaching the Bible is purchased at the price of much study, some of it lonely, all of it tiring. If you are not a student of the Word, you are not called to be a teacher of the Word.**
