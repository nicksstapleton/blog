## It's not the plane, it's the pilot
In _Top Gun: Maverick_ there is a repeated mantra: **It's not the plane, it's the pilot.**

Logos is an incredible tool for learning, Bible study, and ministry. Yet, Logos is only as good as the resources inside of it. **It's not Logos, it's the resources.**

If you want the best commentaries and dictionaries to appear in your Logos searches, they need to be in your libary. 

One of the strengths of Logos is its vast catalog. When I began building my library, I wanted someone to tell me which resources were most helpful to them in their ministry, sermon prep, and personal Bible study. This is where I want to offer you help.

**You want to invest in great reference tools you will utilize over and over again for years to come.** To achieve this it is best to think through categories and then select best resources. Here are the six categories to prioritize:

* Bible dictionaries
* Theological dictionaries
* Commentaries
* Systematic + Biblical Theologies
* Greek / Hebrew Texts + Lexicons
* Other reference resources (study bibles, favorite books, etc.)

## Don't Sleep on Logos Base Packages
The most cost-effective way to get resources in Logos is with a base package. A base package is the foundation you want to build on. If you want help choosing a base package, read my [Logos Buyer's Guide](https://www.nickstapleton.me/logos-buyers-guide/).
